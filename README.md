This project applies classical machine-learning algorithms to classify human
activities using the Daily and Sports Activities (DSADS) dataset. 
Three models were implemented: K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce dimensionality.
